# 🚗💡 Carbon Credit Tracking for EV Systems  

## 📌 Overview  
This project provides an **IoT-based carbon credit tracking system** for organizations using **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**. The system accurately tracks carbon credits earned through EV usage and allows organizations to either **sell credits** or **redeem incentives** from the government.  

## 🏗️ Key Components  
1. **IoT System**: Collects real-time data on EV usage, charging patterns, and emissions saved.  
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Analyzes collected data to calculate carbon credits earned.  
3. **Application Dashboard**: A web/mobile application for organizations to monitor carbon credits and manage transactions.  

## 📦 Features  
✅ **Automated Carbon Credit Calculation**: Tracks and verifies carbon savings based on EV usage.  
✅ **Secure Ledger for Transactions**: Allows organizations to sell or redeem credits.  
✅ **IoT-Enabled Data Collection**: Uses real-time sensors for accurate tracking.  
✅ **Government Compliance**: Ensures adherence to official carbon credit policies.  
✅ **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Visual insights and reports on carbon credit earnings.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **IoT**: Raspberry Pi / ESP32 + Sensors  
- **Machine Learning**: Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn)  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Flask / FastAPI  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / Firebase  
- **Frontend**: React / Flutter  
- **Blockchain (Optional)**: Ethereum / Hyperledger for secure credit transactions  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **IoT devices** monitor EVs and send data to the cloud.  
2. **ML models** process the data and calculate carbon credits.  
3. **Dashboard** displays carbon credits earned in real-time.  
4. **Users can sell or redeem credits** through the platform.
